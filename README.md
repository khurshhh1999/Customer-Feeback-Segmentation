Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Product Reviews
This project at Northeastern University focuses on applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews. Our aim is to categorize sentiments as positive or negative, providing insights for both potential buyers and sellers.

Overview
Leveraging advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, we aim to decipher the emotional tone behind textual reviews, guiding purchasing decisions and offering sellers consumer feedback insights.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: Utilizing NumPy and Pandas for organizing and cleaning the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Identifying patterns and sentiment distribution across products.
Feature Engineering: Balancing the dataset and preparing it for model training.
Model Training and Evaluation: Comparing various machine learning models based on classification accuracy and ROC score.
Goal
To provide aggregated sentiment scores for products, drawing a detailed portrait of customer sentiments, highlighting pros and cons for each product.

To run:
Final1.ipynb can be run on any python environment. The dataset is already included in the repository.

Tools and Models Used
TF-IDF and Word2Vec for vectorization.
Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and RNNs among the models evaluated.
ROC-AUC score for model evaluation.

Conclusion
Our project offers a comprehensive approach to understanding customer sentiment, supporting businesses in enhancing product offerings and fostering a dynamic e-commerce environment.

Future Work
For future work, integrating this sentiment analysis model into an MLOps pipeline represents a strategic advancement. This involves automating the model training, evaluation, and deployment processes, ensuring continuous integration and delivery. Developing a prototype within an MLOps framework facilitates real-time analysis and adaptability to new data, significantly enhancing product and service feedback mechanisms. This approach not only streamlines the deployment of machine learning models but also aligns model development with ongoing product enhancements, ensuring that sentiment analysis capabilities evolve in tandem with user feedback and product changes.
